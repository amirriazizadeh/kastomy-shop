🌍 Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the project root with the following keys (example values provided):

# Django
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1

DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/shop_db

# Celery / Redis
CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0

🐳 Running with Docker

Build and start the containers

docker-compose up --build

The API will be available at:
👉 http://localhost:8000
⚡ Running Celery

To enable background tasks, run Celery worker and optionally Celery beat:

# Start Celery worker
celery -A core worker -l info

# Start Celery beat (for periodic tasks)
celery -A core beat -l info

If using Docker, these services are already defined in the docker-compose.yml.

# Using Django's test runner
python manage.py test

# Or if pytest is installed
pytest
